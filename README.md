## Key Features

-   **Real-World Scenarios:** Utilize a collection of high-definition aerial videos from unstructured urban environments, including dynamic obstacles like cars and people.
-   **Emulated Aerial Vehicle (EAV):** Navigate within video scenarios using a virtual moving camera that responds to high-level commands.
-   **Standardized Evaluation:** Provides a safe and fair baseline for comparing different visual navigation solutions under identical, repeatable conditions.
-   **Development & Data Generation:** Facilitates the rapid development of autonomous landing strategies and the creation of custom image datasets for training machine learning models.
-   **Safety-Focused:** Enables rigorous testing and debugging of navigation logic in a simulated environment, eliminating risks to hardware and ensuring compliance with safety regulations.
